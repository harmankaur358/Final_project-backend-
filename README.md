## WEATHER FORECAST API

# Project Concept
The weather forecast API is back-end application that provides the weather information 
of different cities to users. In this application, user can view forecasts of all cities, 
a specific one and check severe weather alerts.I choose this theme as I found this theme 
extremely useful and it would be a great example how the back-end works in real world 
appplications.It will provide me opportunity to experience all compoments together such 
as Authenication,Authorization, Validation, Documentation and testing.

# Scope and Functionality
There will three major components of this API: 
1.Forecasts: Weather information such as temperature,humidity, wind speed for each location.
2.Locations: Includes the information about the locations.
3.Alerts: Weather alerts such as storms, rainfall for all locations.

Major features:
Authenication: Firebase Authenication based on tokens.
Authorization: Role based accesses to the different parts of application.
Testing: Jest tests will test each component of application.
Data validation: User input will be validated by Joi. 
Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI will document all endpoints.

# Course Content Alignment
Node.js, TypeScript, Express: Will be used as a foundation of the project. 
Firebase Firestore and Authentication: Used for data storage and firebase
authenication for authenicating users by validating tokens.
Authorization: Role based access such as user, admin for weather endpoints.
Jest for testing: Each compoment Will be tested by using Jest.
Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation: To make the application for readable for 
other developers swagger/OpenAPI Will be used for documentation.
Joi for validation: Validates the user inputs and manages the models.
